      <h1>We are building a prosthetic hand that people can grow with, repair, and own.</h1>
      <p>
        This project exists because access should not depend on price, geography, or a closed supply chain.
        We build in public so every test, failure, and improvement becomes a shortcut for the next person.
      </p>

      <h2>Why we build</h2>
      <p>
        Many prosthetic hands are expensive, hard to repair, and slow to update. Kids outgrow fittings quickly.
        Our answer is an open, modular hand that can be rebuilt, repaired, and improved by anyone with basic tools
        and a printer.
      </p>
      <p>
        The goal is not only a device, but a shared process that helps more people build, learn, and regain agency.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="simple-section" id="principles">
      <h2>Principles</h2>
      <ul class="simple-list">
        <li><strong>Human-first design.</strong> Comfort, natural motion, and daily tasks guide every decision.</li>
        <li><strong>Growth-ready.</strong> Replaceable parts and sizing guides keep the hand useful as kids grow.</li>
        <li><strong>Repairable everywhere.</strong> Clear parts lists and documented tools prevent supply lock-in.</li>
        <li><strong>Dignity and agency.</strong> A hand should feel like support, not a reminder of what is missing.</li>
        <li><strong>Open progress.</strong> Every test, failure, and fix is logged so the community can improve faster.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="simple-section" id="impact">
      <h2>Who this helps</h2>
      <p>
        We design for classrooms, homes, clinics, and workshops. The hand should be adaptable to people and
        environments that change.
      </p>
      <ul class="simple-list">
        <li><strong>Kids and teens.</strong> Modular upgrades keep costs low and fit changes quick.</li>
        <li><strong>Parents and caregivers.</strong> Clear assembly and repair guides reduce downtime.</li>
        <li><strong>Clinicians and therapists.</strong> Open notes help review alignment, grip patterns, and comfort.</li>
        <li><strong>Makers and students.</strong> An open platform to learn biomechanics and human-centered design.</li>
        <li><strong>Resource-limited communities.</strong> Open files and local fabrication reduce dependency.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="simple-section" id="process">
      <h2>How we work</h2>
      <p>
        Open hardware only works when the process is as visible as the result. This is the loop that keeps the
        hand improving and the community aligned.
      </p>
      <ol class="simple-steps">
        <li><strong>Listen and define.</strong> Gather feedback from users, parents, and clinicians.</li>
        <li><strong>Prototype and assemble.</strong> Print parts, assemble modules, track what breaks.</li>
        <li><strong>Measure and document.</strong> Log grip tests, cable tension notes, and wiring diagrams.</li>
        <li><strong>Share and invite.</strong> Publish results and open new tasks for the community.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section class="simple-section" id="open-source">
      <h2>Open source commitment</h2>
      <p>
        We publish the design files, firmware, and documentation so anyone can study, build, or improve the hand.
        The repo license defines the exact terms; our commitment is to keep access open and credit clear.
      </p>
      <ul class="simple-list">
        <li><strong>Transparency.</strong> Everyone can see the design logic, not just the final model.</li>
        <li><strong>Resilience.</strong> If one team pauses, another can keep building.</li>
        <li><strong>Local adaptation.</strong> Communities can tune the hand to local materials and needs.</li>
        <li><strong>Faster iteration.</strong> More eyes on the build means faster fixes.</li>
      </ul>

        <h3>Why you should contribute</h3>
        <p>Contributing is not just coding. It is impact, learning, and shared credit.</p>
        <ul class="simple-list compact">
          <li>Help a kid regain daily independence.</li>
          <li>Build a portfolio piece with real-world stakes.</li>
